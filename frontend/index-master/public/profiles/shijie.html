        Hello. My name is Shijie Liu and I'm a senior attending University at buffalo majoring in computer science. I am Chinese and I was born in China. This is my 
        second project creation course with my first one being CSE442. I have learnt a couple of things regarding the frontend for my CSE442 project so I am intrigued
        to create a project that is mostly concentrated on the frontend elements of a project. My favorite hobbies include video editing as well as video games, specifically
        fighting games. My picture is of a game pad that is used for fighting games since that is representative of my hobby.
