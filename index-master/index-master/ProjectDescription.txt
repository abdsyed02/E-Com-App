Our Vision:
        Team Index aims to develop a web application that would enable the members of the UB community to borrow, rent, loan, buy and donate products amongst each other. The application will help students by providing them a platform to get essential items like books and laptop chargers on time at reasonable prices. Our platform is a social media application that will primarily be a university-specific online marketplace, but it would also enable our users to connect to other fellows at UB by becoming a forum where people can get to know newer people.
        We all have been in situations where we forget items like chargers, laptops, books, and other college necessities at home while coming to the campus. Our application provides a solution to this problem by helping UB become a close-knit community where people can use an online platform to borrow, rent, loan, buy and donate products in case of need. Any individual who is a part of the UB community will be welcomed on our platform. Using a well-designed “web application”, we will try our best to provide our users an efficient and effective experience. We will use React frontend to create a user-friendly interface. We will implement chatting features, payment gateways, and a few other essential features using third-party (highly likely RESTful) APIs.
