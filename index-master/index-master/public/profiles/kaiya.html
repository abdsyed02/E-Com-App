        Hello, my name is Kaiya Hogg, I am a junior in computer science at the University at Buffalo. I am originally from <br />
        Tokyo, Japan but grew up in Ithaca, New York. I kind of like coding up abominations (such as this page) but I have a passion for <br /> 
        problem solving. Above is one of the only images of me on my phone. I think I might be gaming in it, it was taken a couple <br />
        years before I learned how to code.
